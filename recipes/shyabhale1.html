        <h2>What is Shyabhale?</h2>
        <p>It is a dish widely loved both by Nepali and the Tibetan community and is a must-have dish at any Tibetan gathering. Shabhaley is a Tibetan dish made of bread stuffed with seasoned meat and cabbage, which is then fashioned into semi-circular or circular shapes. According to regional variations, it is either deep or pan-fried.

        </p>
        <p>Some people eat them for breakfast, but typically, shabhaley is served with lunch or dinner, often with a basic soup. In Tibet, the most common meat would be that of yak, which is a bit leaner and stronger tasting than buff. But outside Tibet, you will usually find them made from beef or veggies. Tibetan shabhaleys are essentially meat pies. The dough is crunchy on the outside and gooey on the interior. If you like non-veg, you should not miss out on this.</p>
